Implementation:

1. Event Controller:

- Implement an event controller that handles incoming event requests.
- Parse the event data from the request body.
- Execute the corresponding marketing flow using the executeFlow function.
- Send a response indicating the success or failure of the flow execution.

2. Flow Executor:

- Implement a function executeFlow that takes an event and executes the corresponding marketing flow.
- Use the flows object to determine the appropriate flow based on the event type.

3. Testing:

- Write unit tests to ensure the correct behavior of the event controller and flow executor. (I haven't done flow executor)
- Test different scenarios, including successful execution, error handling, and response validation. (I haven't done all of them)

Solution:

**Event Controller**: Implemented an event controller that handles incoming event requests, executes corresponding marketing flows, and sends appropriate responses.
**Flow Executor**: Created a function to execute marketing flows based on the event type.
**Tests**: Developed unit tests using Jest and Supertest to verify the functionality of the event controller and flow executor.

Usage:

Send a POST request to `/api/trigger-event` with event data in the request body to trigger an event and execute the corresponding marketing flow.

Additional Considerations:
However, there are several potential drawbacks to this solution. If the endpoint anticipates significant traffic, there is a risk of accumulating numerous scheduled callbacks, potentially leading to stack consumption issues. Additionally, in the event of a failure, the user may not receive any notification.

For larger or more critical projects, it is advisable to explore alternative approaches. One option is to utilize a cronjob package or implement an external storage mechanism, such as Redis, to queue pending messages. This setup allows for separate processing of tasks, with a dedicated process responsible for reading queued tasks and executing the necessary actions, such as sending emails.

In order to improve the system, it's important to handle different types of data that may be received in the request body. Implementing error handling for cases where incorrect data is provided can enhance the system's resilience and user experience. These adjustments will help ensure that the system can effectively manage diverse data inputs and handle errors better.
